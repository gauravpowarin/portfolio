# About me

My name is Gaurav Powar. I’m a robotics developer, and open-source enthusiast based in India.

I am a research scholar at IISER Berhampur with a deep passion for **robotics, artificial intelligence, and computational sciences**. My academic journey has been quite eventful—I secured **AIR 213 in JEE-Mains, AIR 197 in the IISER Aptitude Test, and ranked 3rd among Indian students in the Gao-Kao Entrance Exam**.

I have always been drawn to innovation and problem-solving, which led me to become the **Team Captain of Team Innovobotix**, where I guided my team to victory in a **national robotics championship in 2020**. I am also a **founding member of The Up & Atom Club**, a platform dedicated to fostering curiosity and scientific discussions.

My interest in computing and AI helped me achieve **AIR-10 in the Computing Intelligence Olympiad in 2017-18**, and the following year, I secured **AIR-01** at the national level. In 2020, I became a certified **Arduino developer** through **E-Cell IIT Bombay**, which strengthened my skills in **IoT and embedded systems**. Since 2019, I have been an active contributor to **open-source robotics**, believing in the power of collaborative innovation.

Beyond academics and robotics, I have a keen interest in **astronomy, IoT hardware tinkering, quiz competitions, MUNs (Model United Nations), and curating music playlists**. I enjoy exploring new ideas and pushing the boundaries of technology.

Right now, I’m working on a **centralized blood donor tracking system** to prevent over-donation and make ethical blood donation practices more accessible. I’m also developing a **standalone interest calculator for Windows** to assist in offline financial computations.

My goal is to drive impactful technological advancements by leveraging my expertise in **AI, robotics, and open-source development**, and I’m always looking for new challenges to tackle!
